# Kanopi Pack - Webpack Orchestration

## Configuration

A full list of available configuration options along with default values or direction are included in `sample.kanopi-pack.json`. @kanopi/pack searches your project directory for a JSON file named `kanopi-pack.json` or a CommonJS file called `kanopi-pack.js` in either the root or `assets/configuration` folder.
